# simple-banking-system-
This is a Simple Banking System project which i have done for my web development internship at The Sparks Foundation.

How to run the source code??
    >> First we need the Xampp Application to be installed in your system.
    >> Next download the zip file of the source code 
    >> Extract the files from the zip folder.
    >> If you need to do any changes to the  database u can do it in the sql file.
    >> Next save the extracted file in the pathway such as C/xampp/htdocs/banking.
    >> Once it is saved then open the browser and type localhost to open the xampp homepage and then click on the phpMyAdmin on the left corner.
       Note:- Do not forget to start the Apache and MySQL on the XAMPP Control Panel.
    >> Create a new database  "banking" and then import the SQL file from the pathway "C/xampp/htdocs/banking/company.sql".
    >> Once the files get imported successfully then open the browser and then browse "localhost/banking" 
    Now the project gets open......And you are ready to go.......
